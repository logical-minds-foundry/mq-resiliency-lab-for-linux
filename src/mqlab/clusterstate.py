"""Cluster-state collector for the PCMK drill cockpit (#177, Plan 1a).

Stdlib-only so this exact file is deployed verbatim to the pcmk/san guests as
/usr/local/bin/lab-cluster-state and run by a 5s systemd timer, AND imported by the
repo's unit tests. Pure parse functions turn command output into metric rows;
render_cluster_state_prom turns rows into a node_exporter textfile; probe() runs each
source bounded + non-blocking (timeout -> no fresh sample -> the cell reads STALE).
